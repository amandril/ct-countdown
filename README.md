Countdown to the Colorado Trail.

Hilary and I are thru-hiking the Colorado Trail! 

This site will help chronicle the planning we're doing for it and the experiences we'll have on the trail.

Plans include a javascript counter for days left until we leave, a drawing script to overlay the map as you scroll through timestamped posts, and lots of photos.
